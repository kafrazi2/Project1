-   [Requirements](#requirements)

This document is a vignette to show how to retrieve data from an
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). To demonstrate, I’ll be
interacting with the NHL API. I’m going to build a few functions to
interact with some of the endpoints and explore some of the data I can
retrieve.

# Requirements

To use the functions for interacting with the NHL API, I used the
following packages:

-   [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/): tons of useful features
    for data manipulation and visualization
-   [`jsonlite`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/): API
    interaction
