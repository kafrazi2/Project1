This document is a vignette to show how to retrieve data from an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). To demonstrate, I'll be interacting with the NHL API. I'm going to build a few functions to interact with some of the endpoints and explore some of the data I can retrieve.

# Requirements 

To use the functions for interacting with the NHL API, I used the following packages:

- [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/): tons of useful features for data manipulation and visualization
- [`jsonlite`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/): API interaction

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load in the packages.
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
```
